        <h3>Welcome to Enrico's Research Pages.</h3>

<p>In this page, I will put anything related to my research, e.g published paper, research timelines, progress report, etc.</p>

<p>This page is still under construction. The content in this page will be updated very soon.</p>

<h3>AuthScan++</h3>

<p>Although implementing security protocol is critical to the whole security in SSO schemes, authentication protocol have historically been hard to design correctly and implementation have been found susceptible to logical flaws. There have been studies on flaws that has been discovered in several popular SSO websites to show that the SSO scheme is not as secure as we might think it be even when the schemes has proven secure. Thorough security analysis could be a solution to this problem, but such analysis faces several challenges, including lack of technical documentation. Analysis could be more difficult due to the complexity in authentication protocol implementation.  Based on this problem, a tool that can recover the authentication protocol without requiring any knowledge of the protocol would be an important contribution to answer the problem.</p>

<p>We design and build a tool that can automatically extract web authentication protocols. This works is mainly based on AUTHSCAN, an end-to-end platform to automatically recover authentication protocol specifications from their implementation. In specific, we will focus on building a robust implementation of the black-box and white-box component in AUTHSCAN. We hope that this tool could help security analyst understand the authentication schemes by analyzing the inferred authentication protocol in a particular website provided by our tool. From this point onwards, we will call this tool AUTHSCAN++.</p>
